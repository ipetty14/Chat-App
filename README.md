# Chat-App
Chat App in Node.js that uses Express.js, Socket.io and Yargs.

To run server:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this directory and navigate to it
3. Run command "npm install" in the directory
4. Run command 'node server --host="10.0.1.1" --port="3456"' 
(NOTE: that the host and port only need double quotes if run on a Windows machine. Single quotes or no quotes and no spaces will do just fine on Mac & Linux.)
5. Open up a browser and got to the host 10.0.1.1:3456 and begin using the app

Note: Host and port should be whatever you require them to be. Above are simply examples.
